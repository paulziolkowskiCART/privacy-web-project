           <h3>Take Action</h3> 
           <p>The best way to take action against surveillance and other means of violating user privacy, is to stop and reflect. Determine who or what the user is trying to protect their privacy from? This will help build their privacy threat model. Knowing this will help further benefit, improve, and protect their digital privacy.
            Once one has established their threat model, they must determine how to combat surveillance and data collection. One way is to simply stop using online services that violate their user’s privacy. One way to check this is to read the service’s privacy policy. This will inform the user what the service collects and shares in terms of personal data. Another way is to limit providing any personal information to online services the user doesn’t trust. Other ways may depend on the user’s threat model.</p>

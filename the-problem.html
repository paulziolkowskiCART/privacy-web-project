            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                More and more people connect to the Internet every day.<br><br>
                In today’s age of access, all types of information can be accessed all over the Internet. However, its
                convenience comes at a cost: cost of user privacy. Companies and government agencies online collect and
                harvest data about their users by various different means. Most common of which, is what users provide
                to them. That may be information like phone numbers, names, or emails. Information that may identify a
                user is often called private information. They violate their users’ privacy by collecting excessive
                amounts of their private information often when it is not necessary. They may fail to protect their
                users’ private information and private information may be shared by third parties. Surveillance is a
                byproduct of this.<br><br>
                The problem with this, is that it can contribute to targeting of individuals by various means. It can
                also contribute to surveillance, spying, or profiling of certain individuals. This is the problem with
                digital privacy online.<br><br>
